Only about 50 percent can expect to survive the disease for five years. But researchers say that the odds of making it to that five-year mark are significantly improved if women with ovarian cancer are also taking a common diabetes drug. \nResearchers at Mayo Clinic in Minnesota found that 67 percent of women diagnosed with ovarian cancer who were also taking the diabetes drug metformin lived five years or more after their cancer diagnosis. That's significantly better than the 50 percent of women who survived at least five years with cancer who were not taking the diabetes drug.\nSanjeey Kumar, a gynecologic oncologist at Mayo Clinic, says researchers are not sure how metformin extends the life expectancy of some ovarian cancer patients, but he says they have a number of theories. \u201cSuch as acting through stem cells, cancer stem cells, or depriving the cancer cells of energy supply or glucose,\u201d he explained.\nStem cells are master cells that can transform into any tissue in the body. In the ovaries, the stem cells produce normal ovarian cells. But the influence of certain genes, which researchers are just now starting to identify, can turn the master cells into deadly cancer.\nMetformin, an oral medication, reduces harmful levels of so-called bad cholesterol and blood fats known as triglycerides in type 2 diabetics. The drug also has been shown to prevent heart disease in people with diabetes, and is used occasionally to treat a condition known as polycystic ovarian disease, which causes small cysts on the ovaries and abnormal reproductive hormone levels.\nIn the Mayo Clinic study, researchers compared the survival of 61 ovarian cancer patients taking metformin to that of 178 women with cancer who were not on the drug.\nAfter accounting for factors such as the patient\u2019s weight, cancer severity and their chemotherapy regimens, they found that women on metformin were nearly four times more likely to survive at least five more years than women not on the drug.\nThere are very few treatment options available for ovarian cancer, which tends to be resistant to chemotherapy. So Kumar envisions - after larger clinical trials are conducted - eventually giving women with the disease metformin to improve their prognosis.\n\u201cAnd if the trials validate the findings of our study, then we would say that would say 'yeah,' that would be the time to change our practice and start recommending metformin for people who do not have diabetes,\u201d Kumar stated.\nThe results of the study on the effectiveness of the diabetes drug metformin in treating ovarian cancer are published in the journal Cancer.\n", "title": "Researchers compared the survival of 61 ovarian cancer patients taking Metformin to that of 178 women with cancer who were not on the drug and found women taking the drug were nearly four times more likely to survive at least five more years.\n", "qas": [{"question": "what gender group did metformin study ?", "id": "0", "arguement": "Transaction.TransferOwnership_Recipient", "answers": [{"text": "women", "answer_start": 149}]}], "url": ["https://gdb.voanews.com/3CE10478-B836-4463-8896-1A227417B7A8.jpg"], "trigger": ["taking"], "id": 0, "caption": ["Researchers compared the survival of 61 ovarian cancer patients taking Metformin to that of 178 women with cancer who were not on the drug and found women taking the drug were nearly four times more likely to survive at least five more years ."]}, {"context": "Toronto Council Strips Besieged Mayor of Some Powers\nTORONTO \u2014\u00a0\nToronto city council voted to strip scandal-plagued Mayor Rob Ford of some of his powers on Friday, but Ford, who admits he smoked crack cocaine while in office, promised to challenge the moves in court.\nWith few legal mechanisms available to remove Ford from office, Toronto city councilors across the political spectrum have been searching for ways to curb the power of the populist mayor, who was elected in 2010 on a promise to save taxpayers' money.\nFord said he understood why councilors were voting to reduce his power, but said he has no option but to launch a legal challenge, even though it will waste the city's money in legal fees.\n\u201cIf I would have had a mayor acting the way I've conducted myself, I would have done the exact same thing,\u201d Ford said of council's vote.\n\u201cObviously, in my situation I have to support myself, and I think anybody in my position would have done the same.\u201d\nIn comments that have made international headlines, Ford has admitted to buying illegal drugs and driving after consuming alcohol, as well as to having used crack. But he says he was elected to do a job and that he won't step down.\nHe has also vowed to run for mayor again in next October's election.\nCouncil voted 39 to three to suspend the mayor's ability to appoint and dismiss the deputy mayor and the heads of council committees. Ford and his brother, Councilor Doug Ford, and one other councilor voted no.\nCouncil also voted 41 to two to give the deputy mayor, rather than the mayor, special powers during emergencies such as natural disasters. Only the Ford brothers voted no.\n\u201cWe have been frankly fortunate that no emergencies have landed on the same dates on which we know the mayor's judgment may have been impaired,\u201d said Councilor John Filion, who proposed the changes. \u201cThe members of council that I've spoken to do not wish to push our luck on that.\u201d\nCouncilors, some of whom have pointedly turned their backs on Ford while he has spoken in recent meetings, are expected on Monday to consider slashing his office budget.\nThe furor over the mayor's drug use emerged in the spring after U.S. media blog Gawker and the Toronto Star newspaper both said they had viewed a cellphone video that appeared to show him smoking crack cocaine.\nFord spent months dodging questions about the video, but admitted earlier this month that he had used the drug \u201cin one of my drunken stupors\u201d.\nThe saga, punctuated by Ford's combative exchanges with reporters and by his emotional apologies, has transfixed Toronto residents and late-night comedy writers alike.\nOn Thursday afternoon, the mayor apologized for an obscene outburst made as he denied an allegation he had made sexual overtures to an employee. He said he is getting professional help regarding his drinking.\n", "title": "Toronto Councilor Doug Ford, left, speaks to brother, Mayor Rob Ford, during city council meeting, Nov, 15, 2013.\n", "qas": [{"question": "who is toronto 's mayor ?", "id": "1", "arguement": "Contact.Meet_Participant", "answers": [{"text": "Rob Ford", "answer_start": 60}]}, {"question": "who is toronto 's mayor ?", "id": "2", "arguement": "Contact.Meet_Participant", "answers": [{"text": "Rob Ford", "answer_start": 60}]}, {"question": "in what state was doug ford 's council meeting meeting ?", "id": "3", "arguement": "Contact.Meet_Place", "answers": [{"text": "city", "answer_start": 77}]}], "url": ["https://gdb.voanews.com/81711489-68F0-4D2F-AD6E-ECB74951C0CB.jpg"], "trigger": ["left", "speaks", "meeting"], "id": 1, "caption": ["Toronto Councilor Doug Ford , left , speaks to brother , Mayor Rob Ford , during city council meeting , Nov , 15 , 2013 .", "Toronto Councilor Doug Ford , left , speaks to brother , Mayor Rob Ford , during city council meeting , Nov , 15 , 2013 .", "Toronto Councilor Doug Ford , left , speaks to brother , Mayor Rob Ford , during city council meeting , Nov , 15 , 2013 ."]}]}]}
